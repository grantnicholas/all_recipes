If you use pastinas (tubettini, ditalini, pastina, acini de pepe,orzo, etc) or additional beans you made need to add more chicken broth to pot (and especially if reheating leftovers) as the pasta absorbs much of the broth. This does freeze very well (add that extra chicken broth to reheat) Basil can be used instead of or in addition to the sage. If sage is used mince it fine; the basil can be chopped coarsely. You can substitute a can of diced Roma tomatoes for the sun-dried tomatoes if you don't have those. I serve this with bruschetta, or homemade garlic croutons.\r\n                        \n"

Working from the next longest down to the shortest strips, alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving the strips as you go. Press the lattice strips down onto the bottom crust edge to seal, and trim the top crust strips neatly. Press the crust edges with a fork dipped in a little flour to make a crimped edge.",

Empty the contents of the jar into a large bowl and mix until all the ingredients are well combined. 3. Using your hands work in 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 4. Beat 1 egg with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Work this into the flour mixture until well combined. Dough will be a little crumbly. 5. Shape dough into 1 inch sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten the balls with the palm of your hand. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 14 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove cookies to a rack to cool. Makes about 2 dozen cookies."

The bacon or pancetta should be chewy and browned. I am not sure if this would work well with dried basil, but I will attempt that and review at a later date. It is so worth while to buy a big chunk of fresh Parmesan to keep on hand for all pasta dishes. I buy one about once a year, wrap it in paper towel and store in resealable plastic bag in the refrigerator. It will keep beautifully and you are using the finest Parmesan cheese in the world.\r\n                        \n"

In a large mixer bowl, cream together butter, sugars and vanilla at medium speed until creamy and light. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in corn syrup and cream or milk. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add flour mixture, in 3 separate batches, scraping down bowl after each addition. Mix well to ensure full incorporation of flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate) and nuts.",

(Dough will be very sticky. Wetting hands between every 3 rollings of dough will prevent sticking. Simply hold hands under running tap water and shake hands 10 times over sink before handling dough. Don't worry, this will not harm the cookies. I guarantee that this added effort will be worth it for these cookies!) Arrange at least 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. (Cookies will spread a bit during baking.) Flatten each ball of dough slightly with heel of hand or fingers.",

Allow cookies to cool at least 5 minutes while on baking sheets before transferring (with a thin, metal cookie spatula) to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and fresh sheets of baking parchment. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.

            "To Toast Nuts: Toasting nuts brings out their flavor and makes them crisp. It is easy to do. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place nuts, in a single layer, on an ungreased baking sheet. (I like to use my round non-stick pizza pan because it has a lip on it which prevents the nuts from rolling off.) Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring halfway through baking time, or until nuts become fragrant and are lightly browned. (Watch nuts closely to prevent burning.) Cool nuts completely before chopping and adding to recipe. (You can speed up the cooling process by immediately placing hot, toasted nuts onto a plate and place in the freezer for 5 to 8 minutes. Halfway through chilling time, stir the nuts to aid the cooling process.)"

            "Pick up a fried cronut and gently dip the top in glaze; return to rack and let stand until glaze has set, about 15 minutes.",
            "Alternate version: For higher-rising cronuts, roll out finished dough (see Part I) into an 8x12 inch rectangle. Fold dough in thirds and roll out into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick. Cut out 6 cronuts and holes, using a 3-inch round cutter and a 1-inch small hole cutter.",
            "Line baking sheet with waxed paper and dust paper lightly with flour. Place cronuts and holes onto prepared baking sheet and let rise in a draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour.",
            "Carefully pick up and gently drop cronuts, 2 at a time, into the preheated oil. Fry 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. The extra fold and making the dough thicker will result in taller cronuts than before. Let fried cronuts drain on racks.",
            "Dip tops of cronuts in glaze as described above, and let cool on racks to let glaze set up."
